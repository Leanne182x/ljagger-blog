### Career
I am currently a Senior Software Engineer at Sky Betting & Gaming where I work on their in-house trading tools, predominantly using Java, JavaScript (React/Node) and a serverless architecture in Amazon Web Services (AWS). Since working here I have really come to appreciate DevOps culture and have been able to expand my Ops related skills with Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins and developing our Infrastructure As Code with Terraform and Groovy.

I began my career at rentalresult (now Wynne Systems) where I quickly progressed from graduate to leading a team working on a Java desktop application with in-house technologies. From there I moved to a Technical Lead role at CACI developing REST APIs for the rail industry using standard tools and frameworks such as Spring and JPA.

### Certifications
I currently hold two AWS certifications and I am working towards a third.
