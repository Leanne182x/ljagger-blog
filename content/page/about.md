### Career
I am currently a Software Engineer working for Sky Betting & Gaming in their Leeds office. I work on their in-house trading tools predominantly using Java, JavaScript (React/Node) and a serverless architecture in Amazon Web Services (AWS). Since working here I have really come to appreciate DevOps culture and have been able to expand my Ops related skills with Docker, Jenkins and developing our Infrastructure As Code with Terraform, Chef and Kitchen.

I began my career at rentalresult (now Wynne Systems) where I quickly progressed from graduate to leading a team working on a Java desktop application and in-house technology. From there I moved to a Technical Lead role at CACI developing REST APIs for the rail industry using standard tools and frameworks such as Spring and JPA.

### Motivation
I am constantly looking for opportunities to learn more and challenge myself; as a result I look to work with some of the best people in the industry. I am driven to deliver high quality, fit for purpose software and flourish in an environment that truly embraces diversity and inclusion initiatives as opposed to paying it lip service.

### Strengths
As part of a team exercise I took part in the [Gallup Strengths Finder](https://www.gallupstrengthscenter.com/Home/en-US/CliftonStrengths-How-it-Works) in order to understand and embrace our strengths and how they contributed to our squad. Here were my top five themes with snippets of the description as provided by Gallup.

1. **Restorative -** Adept at dealing with problems. Good at figuring out what is wrong and resolving it.
2. **Harmony -** Look for consensus. They donâ€™t enjoy conflict; rather, they seek areas of agreement.
3. **Input -** Have a craving to know more. Often they like to collect and archive all kinds of information.
4. **Discipline -** They enjoy routine and structure. Their world is best described by the order they create.
5. **Learner -** Have a great desire to learn and want to continuously improve.

Honestly I can't say a single one was a surprise and I believe they all benefit me in my chosen career however, some people in my team were surprised that 'Includer' wasn't one of my top five.
