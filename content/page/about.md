### Career
I am currently a Software Engineer working for Sky Betting and Gaming in their Leeds office. I work on their in-house trading 
tools predominantly using Java, JavaScript (React/Node) and more recently Amazon Web Services (AWS). Since working here I have 
really come to appreciate DevOps culture and have been able to expand my Ops related skills using Docker and developing our 
Infrastructure As Code with Terraform, Chef and Kitchen.

I began my career at rentalresult (now Wynne Systems) where I quickly progressed from graduate to leading a team working on a 
Java desktop application and in-house technology. From there I moved to a Technical Lead role at CACI developing REST APIs for the rail 
industry using standard tools and frameworks such as Spring and JPA.

### Motivation
I made the move to CACI as it was a great opportunity to learn and work with tools that are industry standards. I then found myself wanting to work somewhere that would really challenge me and allow me to learn from some of the best engineers in the industry and so I made the move to Sky Betting and Gaming.
