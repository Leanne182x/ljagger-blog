This year the squad I work in at Sky Betting and Gaming have been refactoring our application in order to deploy it into AWS. It is something that we have been excited to work on and wanted to share what we have been up to so I wrote a post for the Sky Betting and Gaming tech blog which you can read [here](http://engineering.skybettingandgaming.com/2017/09/07/trading-on-aws/).

Update: After publishing the post, other publications in the industry got in touch to ask more questions then posted about our move to AWS. Here is a post by [EGR](http://egr.global/intel/news/sky-bet-shifts-trading-platform-to-aws-for-improved-scalability/) and another by [SBCNews](https://sbcnews.co.uk/europe/2017/09/12/peak-performance-sky-betting-gaming-migrates-sky-bet-engine-amazon-web-services/).
